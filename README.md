For one of my computer science classes, we had a project where we had to re-create the Windows 10 programmer calculator in Java. 
The calculator is missing the bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, SRL, and SLL, and also the memory functions, but most of 
the other features of the calculator are implemented. All of the necessary Java files and image files are included in the 
folder, and the main class is located in Calculator.java

This program can be run from the .jar file included.

*** The jar file will not load the images unless they are in the same folder as the jar file. ***

*** Currently, there is a bug where the GUI elements will not show up unless you resize the window. I will fix this soon. ***
